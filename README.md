# ChordCatcher

## Project Scope:

The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision and audio-based system that can automatically transcribe the notes and chords played on a guitar from video recordings. The system should be able to identify the specific notes being played, picking or strumming patterns, and other musical nuances. The target audience for this system includes guitarists of all skill levels who want to quickly transcribe their playing sessions. The system should be able to handle a wide range of playing styles and musical genres, and will be trained on a diverse dataset of guitar playing footage. The system should be developed using a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques, with a focus on accuracy and usability.
